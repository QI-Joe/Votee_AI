# Votee_AI Interview
Here is my coding test reuslt to Votee AI interview. Attached with my answer. 

The solution contains 3 fundmental process for handling a simple word puzzle prediction problem.
1. Data collection
2. Data pre-processing and splitting with standard chunk size
3. The model has been considered for 2 task -- Masked prediction or generation. To represent soltuion for both side, I showcased the answer of RoBERT-base and GPT-2. They are the most classic model for encoder-only and decoder-only Language Model.

In the last, the task presents both methods. Thats all, thank you. Later I may use ChatGPT to decorate the readme.md, I wont change any answer of code after I closed the Zoom meeting.
