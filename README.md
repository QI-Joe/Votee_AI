# Votee_AI Interview

This document contains my coding test results for the Votee AI interview, along with my answers.

The solution encompasses three fundamental processes for addressing a simple word puzzle prediction problem:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preprocessing and Splitting** with a standard chunk size
3. **Model Consideration** for two tasks:
   - **Masked Prediction** -- Encoder-only RoBERTa-base
   - **Generation** -- Decoder-only GPT-2

To represent solutions for both tasks, I showcased the results of RoBERTa-base and GPT-2, which are classic models for encoder-only and decoder-only language modeling, respectively.

In conclusion, the task illustrates both methods. Thank you for your attention. I may later use ChatGPT to enhance this README.md, but I will not change any code answers after closing the Zoom meeting.
